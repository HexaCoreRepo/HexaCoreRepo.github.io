        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Modern 6 3.0.0 Releases Today.</p><br>
        <p>Two years ago, IceCool Tech changed iOS 6 themes forever.</p><br>
        <p>Modern 6 was created out of frustration… Frustration with the idea that it seemed every iOS 6, iOS 5, iOS 4 - every ‘old iOS theme’ embraced the word ‘old’ too much. Plenty released and were never touched again. Other’s became popular, were updated a few times, and then were never touched again... These themes are stuck in 2013. iOS has changed and so has the hardware.</p><br>
        <p>It’s not the design that needs to change, of course, but the technology these themes are run on… Display tech is so vastly different today than it was in 2012. With better color accuracy, higher contrast, higher resolution, higher brightness - and a million other things that these themes are viewed on. So, Modern 6’s main goal from, the start really, wasn’t about the feature set. It was about the quality.</p><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">The first ever release of Modern 6 was beta version 0.1.0, which released on April 10th, 2020 which included 19 high definition app icons.</p><br>
        <p>With Modern 6, it was doing something incredible. Combining high quality icons with an advanced - and vast - feature set... And maintaining that quality. It has proved a challenge. </p><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">From its original release to its later betas, Modern 6 continued to add on to its collection of high definition iOS 6 icons. With 0.6.0, Modern 6’s foundation was completely redesigned. Just a couple of months later, the first stable build of Modern 6, version 1.0, released.</p><br>
        <p>Modern 6 1.0, at the time, was massive. It was the first update that had gone beyond app icons… but only a little. [Version 1.0] more than doubled the amount of high definition app icons, brought Modern 6 to more people with Anemone support, added iOS 6 Settings icons, the working Calendar icon, and more. That’s when it became time to play a game of catch-up. Modern 6 2.0.0 had released only a few months after that, the biggest update to Modern 6 ever, at the time. After getting just Modern 6's feet wet with the iOS 6 Settings icons, Modern 6 gained iOS 6 app badges, UI Sounds, and even the iOS 6 dock. It added a few more app icons, completed the existing set of Settings icons, and many more changes.</p><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">With the release of 2.0, Modern 6 had surpassed every iOS 6 theme on the market. It had even caught up with and was neck-to-neck with the widely popular Classic iOS. That is, until, 3.0.0.</p><br>
        <p>Modern 6 3.0.0 is Modern 6’s biggest update ever. Period. It even deserved a nice tagline!</p><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 20px;">Welcome, Modern 6 3.0.0. Nothing Else Comes Close.</p><br>
        <p>So, what's new?</p><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 18px;">New Features</p><br>
        <li>Entire iOS 6 wallpaper collection right in your devices’ Wallpaper settings*</li>
        <li>Even more iOS 6 UI sounds including the software keyboard</li>
        <li>Native iOS 6 dock reflection</li>
        <li>True iOS 6 app badges with proper shading and fonts</li>
        <li>Native iOS 6 app labels with proper shading and fonts</li>
        <li>iOS 6 boot logo</li><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 18px;">Enhancements</p><br>
        <li>UI Sounds can now be enabled separately</li>
        <li>Improved performance by reducing icon sizing to meet Apple’s design specifications</li>
        <li>Added new Modern 6 icons for each extension respectively</li>
        <li>Updated Clock icon hands better represent iOS 6</li>
        <li>Modern 6 now requires a device running iOS 13.0 or later for an improved experience</li><br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 18px;">Other Changes</p><br>
        <li>Addressed an issue that would cause the Modern 6 dock and badge extensions to be categorized separately for Snowboard users</li>
        <li>Cleaned up Modern 6</li><br>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">"I hope Modern 6 3.0 will pioneer future iOS themes with its incredible set of features. It's our job, as theme and tweak developers, to create packages that keep the jailbreak community alive and well."</p>
