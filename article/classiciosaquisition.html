        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Today, IceCool Tech announces the official aquisition of Classic iOS.</p><br>
        <p>“There is no doubt that people continue to love iOS 6's unique design language almost a full decade after it was discontinued. As a result, iOS 6 themes remain prevalent in the community, with users striving to get as close as possible to the real deal. The problem with this is that there are so many different tweaks and themes needed to achieve this and it can take hours - or longer - just to find these tweaks or themes. And a lot of them, unfortunately, are either low quality or do not work with new iOS releases,” says IceCool Tech (owner, IceCool Tech Repo) adding, “Almost 3 years ago, I decided to put an end to this, with my own iOS 6 theme called Modern 6,” shortly after.</p><br>
        <p>“In April 2020, in a conversation with one of my great friends who some of you may know as Saunders Tech, we expressed our mutual frustration with the existing collection of iOS 6 themes. Problems ranged from low resolution to lack of maintenance, all the way to an unsatisfactory amount of features - assuming the ones included weren't broken on newer iOS releases. I decided it was time for a change, something new was needed.”</p><br>
        <p>Modern 6, being the result of this, as IceCool Tech describes:</p><br>
        <p>“I decided to call it Modern 6. A free, high quality iOS 6 theme that started with a small set of app icons. Over time, I learned a great deal about theme development. I started to veer away from app icons and began to play a game of catch up. It started with features already available on other iOS themes. From the high quality app icon standard I had previously set, I began to implement high resolution Settings icons, iOS 6 [app] badges, [iOS 6] sounds, iOS 6 [app] labels, and the [iOS 6] dock. But it wasn't enough. With its next major release, Modern 6 obtained the iOS 6 software keyboard sound (the only iOS 6 theme I'm aware of that has a working version of this bundled within), dock reflections, and then the biggest feature yet: The whole iOS 6 wallpaper collection. Right in your iOS devices' Wallpaper Settings.”</p><br>
        <p>“Throughout the years, Modern 6 has grown very popular - and very loved. But I felt that too many people continued to use lower quality, less feature rich iOS 6 themes without knowing that there was an alternative out there. On November 22nd, 2022, I wrote to Axel, the developer of perhaps the most popular iOS 6 theme ever. Classic iOS. Just a day later, on November 23rd, the transfer of ownership was complete,” he says.</p><br>
        <p>Modern 6 includes so much more, with the highest resolution and largest amount of features in any major iOS 6 theme available today. It has set a new standard for iOS 6 themes, and hopefully, with features like full wallpaper integration, will influence the future of all different kinds of iOS themes</p><br>
        <p>“Today, I would like to announce that Classic iOS 1.2, the latest release available by its previous owner, is now available on my repo (icecooltech.github.io) with the first update in years currently in the works and will be out very soon. If you are currently using Classic iOS, I strongly encourage you to redownload Classic iOS from my repo in order to receive updates in the near future. I have major plans that I cannot wait to share with you all! And of course, Classic iOS 1.2 will always be available on my repo to download,” he concludes.</p><br>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Long Live Skeuomorphism!</p>
