        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Just a week after IceCool Tech announces Classic iOS acquisition, the latest release of Classic iOS is now available for download on IceCool Tech’s Repo.</p><br>

        <body>
            <fieldset class="field-desc">
               <div class="div1">
                   <img class="logo" src="ClassiciOS.png">
                   <div class="div2">
                   <span class="header-external"><a href="classicios.html" class="main-link3">Classic iOS</a></span>
                   <br>
                   <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's Old is New. Again.</span>

        <p>As IceCool Tech stated in the announcement, “There is no doubt that people continue to love iOS 6's unique design language almost a full decade after it was discontinued. As a result, iOS 6 themes remain prevalent in the community, with users striving to get as close as possible to the real deal. The problem with this is that there are so many different tweaks and themes needed to achieve this and it can take hours - or longer - just to find these tweaks or themes. And a lot of them, unfortunately, are either low quality or do not work with new iOS releases.”</p><br>
        <p>Classic iOS 1.2, the last release by its original owner Axel4, will remain available indefinitely for users who wish to continue using the theme they’ve grown to know and love with added peace of mind that better options are available.</p><br>
        <p>“Classic iOS 1.3 is currently under active development and will be released to the public soon if everything goes well. There is a lot of work to do, but 1.3 will simply focus on updating what needs to be updating,” IceCool Tech noted. He added, “[Version 1.3] will not just be the biggest update to Classic iOS since its release, but it will also serve as the foundation for even bigger changes in the future.”</p><br>
        <p>Classic iOS released almost a decade ago, with little to no change in that amount of time. IceCool Tech is committed to bringing an improved, Modern 6-like experience to the ever popular iOS 6 theme.</p><br>
        <p>“While I’m choosing to stay quiet on my major plans for Classic iOS, I will say that I fully believe  skeuomorphism-lovers will love what I do have planned,” said IceCool Tech.</p><br>
        <p>IceCool Tech’s Repo strives to release only high-quality, feature packed themes. We have a commitment to bringing these incredible experiences to as many people as possible, as many devices as possible, which is why - like all of our other themes - Classic iOS will always remain free.</p><br>
