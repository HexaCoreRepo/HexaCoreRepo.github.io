# Featured: Modern 6 (Beta) - The world's sharpest iOS 6 theme.

## By - IceCool Tech  (YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/c/IceCoolTech)

# Overview

This is my first theme!

There hasn't been a Retina iOS 6 theme in a *long* time - if ever. Every current iOS 6 theme is either pixelated and blurry, and/or incomplete. I, among others, would like that complete, beautiful skuemorphic design from iOS 6 on the latest iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches, as well as the nostalgic feeling that follows in a sharp, stunning look. That's why I'm bringing you an iOS 6 theme that is specifically for the modern high quality displays we have now as well as the latest iOS versions. 

Modern 6 looks **great** with "Six (LS)" from Skittys repo and Classic Badges!

# About the beta

As of right now, the theme is in beta. This means that there may be bugs and not all icons are done or require more work.

During this beta period, you should report any bugs that you come across. However, you can also put in requests for ***known*** third party App Store apps. These apps must have had an iOS 6 or older app icon as well.

If you come across any bugs, report it to me and I *will* see it!

# Requirements

***Prerequisites***

- Cydia, Zebra or Sileo 
- Snowboard or Anemone
- IceCool Tech's repo - https://icecooltech.github.io

I am *uncertain* if this works with Winterboard, as I have not tested it.

# Known issues

None! :)

# F.A.Q

### When will it come out of beta?

When it's ready.

### Will there be a Modern 7?

No. The "Modern" naming scheme will only be used for Modern 6. That *does not* mean I won't have an iOS 7 theme in the future.
