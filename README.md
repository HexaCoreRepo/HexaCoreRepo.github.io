# Modern 6 (Beta) - A modern retina iOS 6 theme.

## By - IceCool Tech  (YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/c/IceCoolTech)

# Overview

This is my first theme.

No one has made an HD iOS 6 theme in a *long* time - if ever. I, among others, would like a new one. That's why I'm bringing you an iOS 6 theme that is specifically for the modern high quality displays we have now. 

Modern 6 looks **great** with "Six (LS)" from Skittys repo and Classic Badges!

# About the beta

As of right now, the theme is in beta. This means that there will be bugs and not all icons are done. This also means that some icons *may* be blurry for the time being. 

During this beta period, you should report any bugs that you come across. However, you can also put in requests for ***popular*** third party App Store apps. These apps must have had an iOS 6 or older specific icon as well.

If you come across any bugs, open a new issue and I *will* see it!

# Requirements & Installation 

**To use this theme, you will need a jailbroken iOS device, Filza File Manager OR Zebra and Snowboard.**

I am *uncertain* if this works with Winterboard or Anemone, as I have not tested them.

To install with Filza File Manager:

1) Download the theme to your jailbroken device from the releases tab. On iOS/iPadOS 13.0 or later, you can download it with Safari.
2) Open it in the Apple Files application. 
3) Copy the .deb file to Filza.
4) Tap the .deb file and select install.
5) Tap "Respring".
6) Open Settings -> Snowboard -> Select theme -> Enable Modern 6.
