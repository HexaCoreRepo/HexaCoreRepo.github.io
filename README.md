# Modern 6 (Beta) - A modern, retina iOS 6 theme.

## By - IceCool Tech  (YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/c/IceCoolTech)

# Overview

This is my first theme!

There has not been a Retina HD iOS 6 theme in a *long* time - if ever. Every current iOS 6 theme is either pixelated and blurry (Non-retina) or pixelated, blurry, *and* incomplete. I, among others, would like that complete, beautiful skuemorphic design from iOS 6 on the latest iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches, as well as the nostalgic feeling that follows in a sharp, stunning look. That's why I'm bringing you an iOS 6 theme that is specifically for the modern high quality displays we have now as well as the latest iOS versions. 

Modern 6 looks **great** with "Six (LS)" from Skittys repo and Classic Badges!

# About the beta

As of right now, the theme is in beta. This means that there may be bugs and not all icons are done or require more work.

During this beta period, you should report any bugs that you come across. However, you can also put in requests for ***Known*** third party App Store apps. These apps must have had an iOS 6 or older app icon as well.

If you come across any bugs, report it to me and I *will* see it!

# Requirements

***Prerequisites***

- Cydia or Zebra 
- IceCool Tech repo - IceCoolTech.github.io

I am *uncertain* if this works with Winterboard or Anemone, as I have not tested them.

# Known issues

Cydia may display Modern 6 update even if on the latest version. 
*Workaround -* Cydia -> Changes -> Modern 6 (Beta) -> Change Package Settings -> Enable Ignore Upgrades

*Note:* You will**not** see available updates when they are available by enabling this!

# F.A.Q

### When will it come out of beta?

When it's ready.
